# This is a very basic expense tracker.

### The App focus on the basics of react and decoupling of code and creating reusable components.

### To run the project

```
    before running the project you have to:
    npm install
    npm start

    This is the most configurations needed unless I modify the package.json
```

### Why Componets

- we focus on reusability and separation of concerns.
- React is formed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Passing Props
  - an example of passing props: goalItem = "props" which inside App component and prop inside CourseGoalItem component.
  ```
  <App/> ---> <CourseGoalItem text={goalItem}> ---> <li>{props.text}</li>

  ```
